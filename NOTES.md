# NOTES

Some notes I found useful:

## CO-RE, BTF, libbpf

CO-RE enables eBPF programs that can run on kernel versions different from the 
versions on which they were built.

Compile Once - Run Everywhere (CO-RE) approach consists of a few elements:

- **BTF (BPF Type Format)**: it is a format for expressing the layout of data 
  structures and function signatures. In CO-RE it's used to determine any 
  differences between the structures used at compilation time and at runtime. 

- **Kernel headers**: `bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h`  
  `vmlinux.h` defines all kernel's data type. When the program is run on a 
  target machine, the user space program that loads it into the kernel will 
  make adjustments to account for differences between this build-time BTF 
  information and the BTF information for the kernel thatâ€™s running on that 
  target machine.  
  Instead of picking the right header file of the structures you are interested 
  in, just include `vmlinux.h`.

- **Compiler support**: Clang compiler was enchanced so that when it compiles 
  eBPF programs with `-g` flag, it includes *CO-RE relocations*, derived from 
  the BTF information describing the kernel data structures.  
  `-O2` optimization flag is required for Clang to produce BPF bytecode that 
  will pass the verifier.  
  If you are using certain macros defined by *libbpf*, you'l need to specify 
  *target architecture* at compile time: you can do this by setting 
  `-D __TARGET_ARCH_($ARCH)`: maybe it is better to say *compile once per*
  *architecture, run everywhere*.

- **Library support for data structure relocations**: 

- **BPF skeleton (optional)**: if you are writing user space code in C (as I 
  am currently doing), you may want to generate functions that user space code 
  can call to manage the lifecycle of BPF programs; the alternative is using 
  directly the functions defined in libbpf library but those may be too low-level.  
  `bpftool gen skeleton example.bpf.o > example.skel.h`.  
  Once the skeleton has been generated, you don't really need the object file 
  anymore.

# Inspect loaded programs

`bpftool` can list all the programs that are loaded into the kernel.

```bash
$ bpftool prog list
...
540: xdp name hello tag d35b94b4c0c10efb gpl
        loaded_at 2022-08-02T17:39:47+0000 uid 0
        xlated 96B jited 148B memlock 4096B map_ids 165,166
        btf_id 254

$ bpftool prog show id 540 --pretty
{
    "id": 540,
    "type": "xdp",
    "name": "hello",
    ...
}
```

You can view all the network-attached eBPF programs:

```bash
$ bpftool net list
xdp:
eth0(2) driver id 540

tc:

flow_dissector:
```

## Parse network packet

```c
void *data = (void *)(long)ctx->data;
void *data_end = (void *)(long)ctx->data_end;

struct ethhdr *eth = data;
if (data + sizeof(struct ethhdr) > data_end)
    return XDP_ABORTED;

if (bpf_ntohs(eth->h_proto) != ETH_P_IP)
    return XDP_PASS;

struct iphdr *iph = data + sizeof(struct ethhdr);
if (data + sizeof(struct ethhdr) + sizeof(struct iphdr) > data_end)
    return XDP_ABORTED;

/* iph->protocol == IPPROTO_ICMP | IPPROTO_TCP | ... */
```
